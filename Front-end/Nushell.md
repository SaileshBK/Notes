The Nushell project aims to merge the Unix shell philosophy of connecting simple commands with the modern style of development. It combines the features of a shell and a programming language into a single package. Nushell draws inspiration from various sources such as traditional shells like bash, object-based shells like PowerShell, gradually typed languages like TypeScript, functional programming, and systems programming. Instead of trying to cover every aspect, Nushell focuses on excelling in specific areas.
